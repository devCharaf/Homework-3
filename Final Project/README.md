# Final Project IFT-6512---Project

This repo contains my final Project of [IFT 6512](https://admission.umontreal.ca/cours-et-horaires/cours/ift-6512/) "Stochastic Programming", a computer science master course at [Université de Montréal](https://www.umontreal.ca/).

You will find a .pdf file which contains a quick review of the necessary tools used in the project as well as results and discussion.

You will also find a .ipynb file containing all the code used to produce the results.

As a formal theoretical physicist, this is my very first short/quick note on a computer science subject.
